# ðŸª„ðŸ“„ TOPICAL: TOPIC pages AutomagicaLly

A tool for automatically generating topic pages for a broad range of biomedical entities and concepts.

A live demo is available at [https://s2-topical.apps.allenai.org](https://s2-topical.apps.allenai.org). See [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01796) for more details.

To run locally, following the instructions below.

## Installation

This repository requires Python 3.11 or later.

### Installing with pip

First, activate a virtual environment. Then, install with `pip` right from GitHub:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/allenai/TOPICAL.git"
```

### Installing from source

If you plan on modifying the code, please clone the repo

```bash
git clone "git+https://github.com/allenai/TOPICAL.git"
cd TOPICAL
```

and install it from source using pip:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or, if you prefer, using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

```bash
# Install poetry for your system: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
# E.g. for Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL)
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Install the package with poetry
poetry install
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can launch the demo with:

```bash
ENTREZ_EMAIL="<your email>" \
ENTREZ_API_KEY="<your Entrez API key>" \
OPENAI_API_KEY="<your OpenAI API key>" \
streamlit run src/topical/app.py
```

`ENTREZ_EMAIL` and `ENTREZ_API_KEY` are optional but highly recommended. You can get an Entrez API key [here](https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/new-api-keys-for-the-e-utilities/).

An OpenAI API key is required. You can provide it in the UI or via the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, with the UI taking precedence.

> __Note__
> To avoid duplicate computation, the output of some steps will cache their results locally. You can get this path by calling `python -c "import topical; print(topical.get_cache_dir())"`.
