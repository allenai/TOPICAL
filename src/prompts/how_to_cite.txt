Every specific scientific claim in the topic page should be followed by an in-line citation to PubMed using the provided PMIDs. E.g. for a PMID of 12345678, format each citation like: "first identified in YYYY ([12345678])...".

Use this syntax and URL EXACTLY. DO NOT under any circumstance format citations differently, e.g. DO NOT place them in an appendix or footnotes section and DO NOT use this syntax: [^1^], which you like to do.

Place each citation IMMEDIATELY after the relevant claim. DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, cram all citations at the end of a sentence. E.g. DO this:

"<entity> is associated with cancer ([12345678]), diabetes ([23456789]) and stroke ([34567891])."

DO NOT do this:

"<entity> is associated with cancer, diabetes and stroke ([12345678], [23456789], [34567891])."

In particular, do not feel that you need to cite all papers belonging to a cluster together.

Consider all the provided literature when deciding what to cite, with a bias toward newer and more up-to-date papers. Try to choose the most appropriate citation per claim, and use the same citation only once. 

Most importantly, do not cite a paper just for the sake of it! Only cite a paper if it provides clear, direct and sufficient evidence to support your claim; topical relevance alone is insufficient. Citing a paper that does not support your claim is worse than not making the claim at all. It is better to cite sparingly than to cite excessively.
