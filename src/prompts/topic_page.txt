Now, generate the topic page section by section following the instructions below.

First, provide a short textbook or Wikipedia-like description of the entity that is easy to understand for a non-expert audience (1 sentence max). Add a line break ("\n\n") after your response.

Then, provide any relevant information about the entities discovery or inception. Be as specific as possible, and include dates or time frames if applicable; if no date or time frame is mentioned in the supporting literature, mention when it first appeared to be studied based on "Publications per year" data you were provided with above, keeping in mind that this data may be incomplete (1 sentence max). If you can identify the paper that introduced the entity, please cite it. Add a line break ("\n\n") after your response.

Next, produce the main content of the topic page. Summarize the main reasons for this entities notability and interest to science. For each reason, include relevant implications, like its impact(s) on (a) particular area(s) of science, human health and disease, the environment, the economy, improvements over state-of-the-art, etc. Mention dates when appropriate, and emphasize more recent information (6 sentences max). Add a line break ("\n\n") after your response.

Finish by commenting on any open questions or future research directions mentioned in the supporting literature, particularly in recently published papers; do not make these up! (1 sentence max).

Before you start, remember to take your time! Consider all previous instructions above and all supporting literature when forming your responses. Don't flip back and forth between topics; structure your response so it is easy to read. Finally, don't overexplain yourself --- use a succinct, specific, and authoritative voice, e.g. avoid phrases like "studies have shown that...", or "this entity is of interest because..." and get to the point!

Note: you can use markdown to format your answer. For example, you can _italicize species names_, or __bold important terms__.
