Now, generate the scientific topic page section by section following the instructions below.

First, provide a short textbook or Wikipedia-like description of the entity that is easy to understand for a non-expert audience (1--2 sentences max). Do not provide citations in this section. Add a line break ("\n\n") after your response.

Next, produce the main content of the topic page (5--8 sentences max). Summarize the main reasons for this entities notability and interest to science. Include relevant implications, like its impact(s) on (a) particular area(s) of science, human health and disease, human culture and society, the environment, the economy, improvements over state-of-the-art, etc. Mention dates when appropriate, and emphasize more recent information. Provide a relevant citation for any specific scientific claim. Add a line break ("\n\n") after your response. Do not add any other line breaks in this section.

Finish by commenting on open questions or future research directions mentioned in the supporting literature, with a heavy bias towards recently published papers, e.g., the last 0--5 years (1 sentence max). Be specific, and do not make these up! You should only cite a paper in this section if it very clearly mentions an open question or future research direction. Do not add any other line breaks in this section.

Structure the topic page so it is easy to read; don't flip back and forth between subtopics, and try to minimize redundancy within and across sections. Finally, don't overexplain yourself -- use a succinct, specific, and authoritative voice, e.g. avoid phrases like "studies have shown that...", "this entity is of interest because...", "the study of entity appears to have begun..." and get to the point!

Before you start, take a deep breath. It is very important for my job that you produce a high-quality topic page, so please take your time and do your best.

Note: you can use markdown to format your answer. For example, you can _italicize species names_, or __bold important terms__.
