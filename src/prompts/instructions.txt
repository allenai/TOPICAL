I will provide you with a biomedical entity or concept, titles and (truncated) abstracts that mention this entity (with publications years up to and including {end_year}), and metadata about the number of publications that mention this entity.

For entities with at least {min_articles_to_cluster} publications, the abstracts will be clustered based on semantic similarity and randomly sampled proportional to cluster size; the first abstract in each cluster is its centroid and should correspond to the central aspect or subtopic of papers in that cluster. If there are fewer than {min_articles_to_cluster} publications, I will provide the top-k most relevant, without clustering. In either case, the provided literature is not expected to be comprehensive or exhaustive but should be representative.
