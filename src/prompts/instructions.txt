I will provide you with a candidate scientific entity or concept, titles and truncated abstracts that mention this entity (with publications years up to and including {end_year}), and metadata about the number of publications that mention this entity.

For entities with at least 100 publications, the abstracts will be clustered based on semantic similarity and randomly sampled proportional to cluster size; the first abstract in each cluster is its centroid and should correspond to the central aspect or topic of papers in that cluster. If there are less than 100 publications, they will be sampled randomly. In either case, the provided literature is not expected to be comprehensive or exhaustive but should be representative.

HOW TO CITE YOUR CLAIMS

Each claim in the topic page should be followed by an in-line citation using the provided {id_type}s, formatted as valid a markdown hyperlink to {id_database}. Format each citation like this:

- "first identified in YYYY ([12345678]({id_url}/12345678))"
- "<entity> is important to aquatic ecosystems... ([12345678]({id_url}/12345678))"

Use this syntax and URL EXACTLY; do not omit any part of it or shorten the URL. Place supporting citations immediately after each claim; do not wait until the end of a sentence, and DO NOT place citations in an appendix or footnotes section.

Avoid using more than three citations per claim. Instead, see if you can break the claim into multiple parts. Cite broadly from the provided literature; try to cite as many relevant publications as possible and use the same citation only once. Finally, making up information or falsely citing a claim is NOT OKAY.
